# Notes for Zero to Production in Rust

[Zero to Production in Rust](https://zero2prod.com) bills itself as "the ideal starting point for your journey as a Rust backend developer."

I have used Rust as hobbyist, mostly in the context of working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) problems.
I also listen to Chris Krycho's [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) podcast which is a great introduction to the language (and certainly the best in the audio-only category).

Zero to Production seems like an obvious next step in my Rust learning journy, and I wanted to use this site to capture my thought and notes along the way.

Zero2Prod is a paid book, so I will not be excerpting any material from the book, but I will bring in code from the public [Github Repo](https://github.com/lukemathwalker/zero-to-production), which is MIT licensed.

I will not be following the book exactly. Notably, I will be diverting from using Actix-Web in favor of Axum as the web server. I will call out additional changes I make along the way.

These notes will be exist in the zero2prod project directory as I work on it.
I will attempt to keep my notes and the proejct progress in sync.

You can find the Repository for this project on [Github](https://github.com/joseph-lozano/zero2prod).

Onwards to [Chapter 1 - Getting Started](./chapter_1.md)!
