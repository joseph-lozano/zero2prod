# Chapter 2 - Building an Email Newsletter

Chapter 2 goes thorugh the goals of the book and the project we will be building: an Email Newsletter.

2.2 Goes over the concept of user stories, and gives us the driving user story for the newsletter:

> - As a blog visitor,
>   I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
>   So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;
> - As the blog author,
>   I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
>   So that I can notify them when new content is published.

2.3 Covers working in iterations. My assumption is that these will correspond to chapters, or perhaps sub-chapters, but that remains to be seen.
Each interation will be properly documeted and tested and fully functional for production, even if the functionality is tiny.

In [Chapter 3](./chapter_3.md) we start building!
